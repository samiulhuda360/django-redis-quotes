# 🔥 Django + Redis Like Counter (Demo Project)

This is a **demo project** created specifically to showcase how to integrate **Redis** into a Django web application.

It’s a minimal, functional app where users can “like” quotes — and those likes are **stored and retrieved using Redis** to demonstrate real-time caching, with periodic sync to the database.

📌 This is not meant to be a full production app — it's a clean, educational project to **highlight my Redis skills** in a Django environment for portfolio and interview purposes.

## 🧪 Note

This project is intentionally kept simple and focused. It serves as a **hands-on demo** of how Redis can be used with Django to cache dynamic data and improve performance.
